## Hi, Iâ€™m Ananya!

I work as an undergraduate research assistant at the [Computational HCI](https://x.com/comphcilab) lab advised by [Dr. Nikola Banovic](https://www.nikolabanovic.net). I lead and contribute to projects supporting end-users through user literacy, critical reflection, and tech policy.

My research interests are in the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), specifically Human-AI Interaction (HAI), and Technology Policy.

I expect to graduate with a BS in [Computer Science](http://cse.umich.edu) from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2025.

I'd love to connect to discuss overlapping interests. Please feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:akasi@umich.edu)!
